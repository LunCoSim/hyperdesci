## About HyperDeSci

HyperDeSci is building a self-sustaining ecosystem for funding decentralized science (DeSci) projects. Unlike traditional grants that provide one-time funding, our Continuous Convertible Grants Framework (CCGF) creates an ongoing funding stream for scientific projects while encouraging successful initiatives to give back to the ecosystem.

We use the $MEGAPI token and Gardens-based governance to create alignment between funders, scientists, and the broader community. Our goal is to become an unstoppable, free, valuable, and expansive system that perpetually supports scientific advancement.

## How It Works

Our ecosystem creates a value flywheel where contributions fund projects, projects create value, value grows the ecosystem, and everyone benefits.

![Funding Mechanism](diagrams/hyperdesci_funding.svg)

1. **Contributors** provide ETH through Juicebox and receive $MEGAPI tokens
2. **Treasury** holds both ETH and $MEGAPI tokens
3. **Governance** directs treasury funds to various funding experiments
4. **Projects** receive continuous funding through these experiments
5. **Successful projects** voluntarily give back to the treasury
6. This creates a **self-sustaining ecosystem** that grows over time

## Juicebox Integration

HyperDeSci is launching on Juicebox, a programmable treasury platform for community funding.

**What this means for you:**
- All contributions are made directly through the Juicebox platform on BASE
- $MEGAPI tokens are distributed automatically when you contribute
- The treasury is transparent and governed by token holders
- Projects receive funding directly from the Juicebox treasury

**How to participate (coming soon):**
1. Visit the HyperDeSci Juicebox page at [URL TBD]
2. Connect your wallet configured for BASE network
3. Contribute ETH to receive $MEGAPI tokens
4. Use these tokens to participate in project funding and governance

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: What is HyperDeSci?**
A: HyperDeSci is an experimental ecosystem for funding decentralized science (DeSci) through continuous, community-driven support rather than one-time grants. We're building a self-sustaining system where successful projects give back to fund future innovation.

**Q: What makes HyperDeSci different from other funding platforms?**
A: Three key differences:
1. **Continuous Funding**: Projects receive ongoing support instead of one-time grants
2. **Convertible Returns**: Successful projects give back to the ecosystem
3. **Community Governance**: Funding decisions are made through low-attention community voting
4. **Experimental Approach**: We're testing different funding mechanisms to find what works best

**Q: What is the $MEGAPI token?**
A: $MEGAPI is the ecosystem token that powers HyperDeSci. It gives holders governance rights to vote on funding decisions and experimental parameters. The tokenomics include 10% distributed to the community and 90% in the treasury to fund scientific projects.

**Q: Is this just another crypto project?**
A: No. While we use blockchain technology and tokens as tools, our primary focus is advancing scientific research and creating public goods. We measure success by scientific impact, not token price.

### For Projects

**Q: How much funding can my project receive?**
A: Funding amounts vary based on the specific funding experiment, community support, and project needs. Initially, we're testing different funding mechanisms with our treasury of 0.15 ETH plus contributions from the Juicebox raise. Each experiment will specify its funding parameters.

**Q: What types of projects qualify for funding?**
A: We focus on decentralized science (DeSci) projects that contribute to public goods. Ideal projects demonstrate:
- Scientific/technical merit
- Community benefit
- Open-source commitment
- Collaboration potential

**Q: What do I need to do to qualify for funding?**
A: Projects need community support through our governance system. You'll need to:
1. Create a proposal
2. Get a community member to nominate your project
3. Receive sufficient support through conviction voting
4. Commit to the Community Covenant

**Q: What are the reporting requirements?**
A: Projects are expected to:
- Share regular progress updates
- Document work openly when possible
- Report on fund usage
- Credit HyperDeSci in publications
- Respond to reasonable community inquiries

**Q: How does the "giving back" part work?**
A: The Community Covenant suggests projects that succeed contribute back through:
- Contributing a portion (suggested 2-5%) of future revenue
- Sharing project tokens with the treasury if applicable
- Buying and holding MEGAPI tokens
- Finding other ways to support the ecosystem

This is a cultural commitment rather than a legal obligation.

### For Investors/Supporters

**Q: What benefits do I get from supporting HyperDeSci?**
A: As a supporter, you:
- Receive $MEGAPI tokens proportional to your contribution
- Get governance rights to influence funding decisions
- Help build a portfolio of innovative science projects
- Potentially benefit from ecosystem growth if projects succeed
- Contribute to advancing important scientific work

**Q: How does the convertible return mechanism work?**
A: When funded projects succeed, they voluntarily contribute back to the ecosystem through various means (revenue sharing, token contributions, etc.). This grows the treasury, allowing more projects to be funded, potentially increasing the value of the ecosystem and $MEGAPI tokens.

**Example scenario:** A project receives $10,000 in funding and later generates $1,000,000 in revenue. Following the covenant, they might contribute 2-5% ($20,000-$50,000) back to the treasury, allowing those funds to support new projects.

**Q: What risks should I be aware of?**
A: Key risks include:
- This is an experimental framework that may evolve significantly
- Token values can fluctuate
- Scientific projects inherently carry uncertainty
- Smart contracts may contain undiscovered vulnerabilities
- The regulatory environment remains uncertain

**Q: How much of my contribution goes to projects vs. operations?**
A: This will be determined through governance, but the initial experiments outlined in the whitepaper include allocations for both project funding and operational needs like marketing and community building.

### Technical Questions

**Q: How do I set up a wallet to participate?**
A: We recommend using MetaMask:
1. Install the [MetaMask extension](https://metamask.io/download/)
2. Create a new wallet and securely store your recovery phrase
3. [Configure MetaMask for BASE network](https://docs.base.org/docs/using-base/network-faucets/)
4. Add some ETH to your wallet for contributions and gas fees
5. Connect your wallet to Juicebox when prompted

**Q: What network does HyperDeSci use?**
A: HyperDeSci operates on the BASE network, not Ethereum mainnet. Make sure your wallet is configured for BASE.

**Q: Is there a minimum contribution amount?**
A: There's no technical minimum, but transaction costs (gas fees) make very small contributions inefficient. We recommend minimum contributions of [TBD] ETH.

**Q: How do I participate in governance?**
A: Governance participation requires:
1. Holding $MEGAPI tokens
2. Signing the ecosystem covenant
3. Staking your tokens on the Gardens platform
4. Voting on proposals using conviction voting

### Community & Governance

**Q: How are funding decisions made?**
A: Funding decisions use conviction voting through the Gardens platform:
1. Project proposals are submitted
2. Community members stake $MEGAPI tokens to support proposals
3. Voting power builds up over time (conviction)
4. When sufficient conviction is reached, funding is approved
5. Projects receive continuous funding according to the experiment parameters

**Q: What can I vote on?**
A: As a $MEGAPI holder, you can vote on:
- Funding experiments
- Parameter adjustments
- Treasury management
- Framework improvements

**Q: Is there a minimum amount of tokens needed for governance?**
A: For governance participation, you need to stake a minimum of 1,000 $MEGAPI tokens. 10% of staked tokens go to the treasury.

**Q: How often are votes held?**
A: Conviction voting is continuous rather than discrete. You can add or remove support for proposals at any time, and when sufficient conviction builds up, proposals are automatically approved.

## First Experiments

### Streaming Quadratic Funding (StreamingQF)
We plan to dedicate a portion of the treasury to continuous quadratic funding, where small contributions from many community members are matched by the treasury. Projects receive real-time funding streams rather than one-time grants.

### DeSci Builder Support
Direct funding for DeSci builders, similar to Commons Protocol. Selected builders can claim daily rewards from a dedicated portion of the treasury.

### $MEGAPI Marketing & Operations
To sustain ecosystem activities and reward active participants, a portion of the treasury will be allocated to marketing, community building, and operations.
